# UFO Sightings

## Overview of Project:
- In this project we colect the UFO sighting info across the world and gather all data in dynamic table by using Javascript language.

- Build a dynamic table to show the UFO sighting records with the ability of filtering the data.

- We collect all data in tidy HTML page to upload on the web and also using the table to manupulate it easily by adding the filter on different column.

## Results

We added multiple search criteria to make the webpage more attractive and interactive for users. 
users can filtered the data on datetime, city, country, state and also shape of UFO sighting.

Using the filter is realy simple just need to fill in the field of each category that you need to filtered by. 

check below for some sample of filtering:
filtered by city: "benton"
In this example we filtered the data on city named "benton". you just need to add the city name in the field and press enter.

filtered by shape: "light"
User also can filter the data based on the shape of sighting. Used light and see the below result:

To reset the table and delete all filtered click on "UFO Sightings" on the top right side of the page.

## Summary

- This new design give the users more ability to filtered the data in different area. 
- To make it even better I have two more recomendation as below:
    - Add one more field to filter "Duration" so users also can go through the time of sighting and check longest duration or shortest one, but for this reason first need to       clean the duration records and make all records to single format. 
    - Refactor the filter function to add the ability of multiple filtering based on multiple selected criteria.
